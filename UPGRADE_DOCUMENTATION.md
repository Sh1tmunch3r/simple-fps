# Comprehensive FPS Upgrade - Documentation

## Overview
This upgrade adds a complete inventory system, advanced building mechanics, loot boxes, and UI improvements to the simple-fps game. All changes are Godot 4.x compatible and maintain multiplayer functionality.

## Major Changes

### 1. Fixed Raycasting (Godot 4.x Compatibility)
**Issue**: Code was using `PhysicsRayQuery3D` which doesn't exist in Godot 4.x
**Fix**: Changed to `PhysicsRayQueryParameters3D`

**Files Modified**:
- `Scripts/player.gd` - Lines 127, 208, 246

**Impact**: All raycasting now works correctly in Godot 4.x

---

### 2. Inventory System

**New Features**:
- Multi-item inventory supporting different types
- Real-time UI display
- Automatic updates on pickup/placement/removal

**Implementation**:
```gdscript
var inventory := {
    "blocks": 0,
    "red_blocks": 0,
    "blue_blocks": 0,
    "items": 0
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `Scripts/player.gd` - Added inventory dictionary, replaced block_count
- `Scripts/block.gd` - Added block_type export variable
- `Scripts/inventory_ui.gd` - New file for UI management

**New Scenes**:
- `Scenes/InventoryUI.tscn` - UI overlay with inventory display

---

### 3. Advanced Block Building System

#### Block Rotation
- **Key**: R (in block placer mode)
- **Function**: Rotates blocks in 90° increments
- **Implementation**: `block_rotation` variable, `rotate_block()` function
- Rotation applied during placement via `spawn_placed_block()`

#### Block Removal
- **Key**: E (in block placer mode)
- **Function**: Removes placed blocks and returns to inventory
- **Implementation**: `remove_block()` function
- Uses raycast to detect placed blocks
- Only removes StaticBody3D objects that are placed blocks

#### Grid Snapping
- Maintained existing grid system
- Supports rotation while maintaining alignment
- Vertical stacking still works correctly

**Files Modified**:
- `Scripts/player.gd` - Added rotation and removal functions

---

### 4. Loot Box System

**Features**:
- Interactive boxes spawned randomly in world
- Press F to loot
- One-time loot per box
- Visual feedback (gold → gray)

**Loot Contents**:
- 5 blocks
- 2 items

**Implementation**:
- `Scripts/loot_box.gd` - Box logic and interaction
- `Scenes/LootBox.tscn` - Box scene with mesh and collision
- Material changes for visual feedback

**Key Functions**:
```gdscript
func interact(player):
    # Called when player presses F
    # Gives loot and marks as looted
```

---

### 5. World Spawning System

**Features**:
- Spawns 10 pickup blocks randomly
- Spawns 3 loot boxes randomly
- Only runs on server/single-player

**Configuration**:
```gdscript
@export var num_pickup_blocks: int = 10
@export var num_loot_boxes: int = 3
@export var spawn_radius: float = 20.0
@export var spawn_height: float = 0.5
```

**Files**:
- `Scripts/world_spawner.gd` - Spawning logic
- `Scenes/World.tscn` - Added WorldSpawner node

---

### 6. UI System

**Components**:

1. **Inventory Display** (Top-left)
   - Shows all item counts
   - Current tool indicator
   - Rotation angle (in block placer mode)

2. **Controls Guide** (Bottom-right)
   - Shows all keybindings
   - Always visible for reference

3. **Interaction Prompt** (Center)
   - Shows "[F] to interact" when near lootable objects
   - Hidden by default

**Implementation**:
- `Scripts/inventory_ui.gd` - UI management
- `Scenes/InventoryUI.tscn` - UI layout
- Auto-finds local player using "players" group

---

## New Controls

| Key | Action | Mode |
|-----|--------|------|
| 1 | Switch to Gun | Any |
| 2 | Switch to Block Placer | Any |
| R | Rotate Block | Block Placer |
| E | Remove Block | Block Placer |
| F | Interact | Any |

## Performance Considerations

- Raycasting limited to 5 units distance
- Shape queries use small collision boxes
- UI updates only when inventory changes (planned)
- World spawning happens once at startup
- Minimal impact on frame rate

## Known Limitations

1. No preview ghost block before placement
2. Cannot rotate placed blocks after placement
3. No save/load for placed blocks
4. Loot box contents are fixed (5 blocks, 2 items)
5. No sound effects
6. No particle effects for visual feedback

---

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Visual Polish**
   - Ghost preview block showing placement position and rotation
   - Particle effects on pickup, placement, removal
   - Sound effects for all actions
   - Better loot box model

2. **Gameplay Features**
   - Multiple loot box types with different contents
   - Crafting system to convert blocks between types
   - Block durability and decay
   - Save/load system for persistent worlds

3. **UI Improvements**

   - Hotbar for quick item switching
   - Minimap showing loot box locations
   - Tutorial popups for new players

4. **Performance**
   - Object pooling for blocks
   - LOD system for distant blocks
