# Multiplayer FPS Enhancements

## Overview
This update significantly enhances the multiplayer experience and core gameplay mechanics of the simple FPS game. All features are fully synchronized across network clients for a seamless multiplayer experience.

## New Features

### 1. Multiplayer World State Synchronization ✅
**Problem Solved**: Joining players now see the same world as the host.

**Implementation**:
- Server spawns all items (blocks, Block2, loot boxes, gun pickups) at random positions
- Spawn positions are stored in arrays on the server
- When a client joins, it requests world state via RPC
- Server sends all spawn positions to the client
- Client spawns items at the same positions

**Files Modified**:
- `Scripts/world_spawner.gd`: Added RPC methods for world state sync
  - `request_world_state()`: Client requests spawn data from server
  - `sync_world_state()`: Server sends spawn positions to client

### 2. Player Spawning and Visibility ✅
**Problem Solved**: Players are now visible and movable to all peers.

**Implementation**:
- Added `MultiplayerSynchronizer` to Player.tscn
- Synchronized properties: position, rotation, health, is_dead, visible
- SceneReplicationConfig ensures all players see each other

**Files Modified**:
- `Scenes/Player.tscn`: Added MultiplayerSynchronizer with replication config

### 3. PvP Combat System ✅
**Features Added**:
- Health system (100 HP default, configurable)
- Damage dealing via shooting
- Death and respawn mechanics (3-second respawn delay)
- Network-synchronized via RPCs

**Controls**:
- Left Click: Shoot (deals 15 damage, 20 when aiming)
- Players respawn at random locations after death

**Implementation**:
- Hitscan shooting with raycasting
- RPC call `take_damage()` when hitting another player
- Death state synced across clients
- Automatic respawn after delay

**Files Modified**:
- `Scripts/player.gd`: Added health, damage, death, respawn functions
- `Scripts/bullet.gd`: Added damage and shooter tracking

### 4. Enhanced Gun Mechanics ✅

#### Aim Down Sights (ADS)
- Hold Right Mouse Button to aim
- Reduces FOV for zoomed view (70 → 50)
- Increases damage (15 → 20)
- Visual feedback in UI

#### Reloading System
- Press R to reload
- 2-second reload time
- Reserve ammo system (90 rounds default)
- Cannot shoot while reloading
- UI shows ammo count and reload status

#### Ammo Management
- Current ammo: 30/30 (default)
- Reserve ammo: 90 (default)
- Depletes on shooting
- Replenishes from reserve on reload

#### Gun Pickups
- 4 gun pickups spawn randomly
- Pickup gives: 30 ammo + 60 reserve ammo
- Automatic pickup on contact
- Synced across network

**Files Added**:
- `Scripts/gun_pickup.gd`: Gun pickup logic
- `Scenes/GunPickup.tscn`: Gun pickup scene

**Files Modified**:
- `Scripts/player.gd`: Added ADS, reload, ammo management
- `Scripts/world_spawner.gd`: Spawn gun pickups

### 5. Block2 Integration ✅
**Features Added**:
- New block type: Block2 (0.5x0.5x0.5 cube)
- Press Q to switch between block types
- Independent inventory tracking
- Separate placement scenes
- Grid snapping for both types

**Files Added**:
- `Scenes/Block2.tscn`: Pickup Block2 scene
- `Scenes/PlacedBlock2.tscn`: Placed Block2 scene

**Files Modified**:
- `Scripts/player.gd`: Added Block2 support to placement system
- `Scripts/world_spawner.gd`: Spawn 5 Block2 pickups

### 6. Loot Box Synchronization ✅
**Problem Solved**: Loot boxes sync state across all clients.

**Implementation**:
- Looted state synced via RPC
- Visual feedback synced (gold → gray)
- One loot per box across all clients
- Updated loot contents:
  - 5 regular blocks
  - 3 Block2
  - 2 items
  - 30 reserve ammo

**Files Modified**:
- `Scripts/loot_box.gd`: Added RPC for loot state sync

### 7. Placed Block Synchronization ✅
**Problem Solved**: Blocks placed by one player appear for all players.

**Implementation**:
- Block placement uses RPC call
- `spawn_placed_block_rpc()` called on all clients
- Works for both block types

**Files Modified**:
- `Scripts/player.gd`: Changed local spawn to RPC spawn

### 8. Enhanced UI ✅
**New Display Elements**:
- Health: Shows current/max health
- Ammo: Shows current/max ammo
- Reserve Ammo: Shows available reserve
- Reload Status: Shows "RELOADING..." during reload
- ADS Status: Shows "ADS: ON/OFF"
- Block Type: Shows current block type (BLOCKS or BLOCK2)
- Block2 Count: Shows Block2 inventory

**Files Modified**:
- `Scripts/inventory_ui.gd`: Updated UI display logic

## Multiplayer Technical Details

### RPC Methods
1. `take_damage(damage, attacker_id)` - Player takes damage
2. `spawn_placed_block_rpc(pos, rotation, type)` - Spawn block for all clients
3. `request_world_state()` - Client requests world data from server
4. `sync_world_state(blocks, block2s, boxes, guns)` - Server sends world data
5. `set_looted()` - Loot box marks itself as looted for all clients

### Synchronized Properties (via MultiplayerSynchronizer)
- Player position
- Player rotation
- Player health
- Player death state
- Player visibility

### Network Safety
- Only server spawns world items (blocks, loot, guns)
- Clients request sync on join
- RPC calls ensure consistency
- Authority checks prevent cheating

## Testing Checklist

### Host Tests
- [ ] Host can see all spawned items
- [ ] Host can pick up blocks/items/guns
- [ ] Host can place blocks
- [ ] Host can shoot and reload
- [ ] Host can loot boxes

### Client Join Tests
- [ ] Client sees same items as host
- [ ] Client can see host player
- [ ] Host can see client player
- [ ] Client can move and jump
- [ ] Client can shoot and reload

### PvP Tests
- [ ] Host can damage client
- [ ] Client can damage host
- [ ] Death triggers respawn
- [ ] Respawn works correctly
- [ ] ADS increases damage

### Building Tests
- [ ] Host places block, client sees it
- [ ] Client places block, host sees it
- [ ] Block2 placement works
- [ ] Block switching (Q) works
- [ ] Block rotation (R) works

### Loot Tests
- [ ] Host loots box, client sees gray box
- [ ] Client loots different box, host sees it gray
- [ ] Cannot loot same box twice
- [ ] Loot gives correct items

### Gun Mechanics Tests

## Known Limitations

1. No preview ghost for block placement
2. No muzzle flash or particle effects
3. No sound effects
4. No HUD crosshair

7. No scoreboard or kill tracking
8. Fixed respawn delay (3 seconds)

## Future Enhancements

1. Add teams (red vs blue)
2. Add scoreboard

6. Add sound effects
7. Add hit markers

## Architecture Notes

### Client-Server Model
- Server is authoritative for world state
- Clients trust server for item spawns
- RPCs used for player actions that affect others
- Synchronizers used for continuous state (position, health)

### Performance Considerations
- World state sync only happens on join (not continuous)
- Placed blocks are local scene children (not synced continuously)
- Raycasting limited to 100 units for shooting
- Minimal network traffic for inventory updates

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive comments added
- RPC methods clearly labeled
- Multiplayer safety checks
- Authority validation
- Error handling for missing references
