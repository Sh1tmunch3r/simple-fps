## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "PhysicsRayQuery3D not found"
**Fix:** This was the old bug. Upgrade includes fix. Ensure you're using latest code.

### Blocks not placing
**Check:**
1. Do you have blocks in inventory? (see UI)
2. Are you in Block Placer mode? (press `2`)
3. Are you aiming at a surface?
4. Is position occupied by another block?

### UI not showing
**Check:**
1. Is `InventoryUI` node in `World.tscn`?
2. Check console for errors
3. Ensure player is in "players" group

### Loot boxes not working
**Check:**
1. Are you pressing `F` while looking at box?
2. Are you within 5 units of box?
3. Has box already been looted? (gray color)

## ü§ù Multiplayer

### How It Works
- Each player has separate inventory
- Inventory is NOT synced between players
- Placed blocks are visible to all
- Loot boxes are first-come-first-served
- World spawning happens once (server-side)

### Testing Multiplayer
1. Start host (creates server)
2. Client joins
3. Both players can:
   - Collect blocks independently
   - Place blocks (all see them)
   - Loot boxes (first player gets items)
4. Each player sees their own UI

---

## üí° Tips for Developers

### Extending the System

**Add new item type:**
```gdscript
# In player.gd, add to inventory:
var inventory := {
    "blocks": 0,
    "your_new_item": 0  # Add here
}

# In block.gd, set block_type:
@export var block_type: String = "your_new_item"
```

**Add new loot:**
```gdscript
# In loot_box.gd, modify interact():
player.pickup_block("your_new_item")
```

**Change spawn counts:**
```gdscript
# In world_spawner.gd or World.tscn:
@export var num_pickup_blocks: int = 20  # Change here
@export var num_loot_boxes: int = 5
```
